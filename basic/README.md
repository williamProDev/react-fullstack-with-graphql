# react-fullstack-apollo-basic

ðŸš€ Basic starter code for a fullstack app based on React, GraphQL & Apollo Client.

## Technologies

* **Frontend**
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/): Frontend framework for building user interfaces
  * [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client): Fully-featured, production ready caching GraphQL client
* **Backend**
  * [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com): Turns your database into a GraphQL API
  * [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/): Fully-featured GraphQL server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience
  * [`prisma-binding`](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding): [GraphQL binding](https://blog.graph.cool/reusing-composing-graphql-apis-with-graphql-bindings-80a4aa37cff5) for Prisma services

## Requirements

You need to have the following things installed:

* Node 8+
* GraphQL CLI: `npm i -g graphql-cli`

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `react-fullstack-basic` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate react-fullstack-basic

# 2. When prompted, choose the Prisma cluster you want to deploy to
# e.g. prisma-eu1 or prisma-us1 to deploy to a public cluster (recommended)
# or locally (requires Docker)

# 3. Navigate into the `server` directory of the new project
cd my-app/server

# 4. Start the server
yarn start # the server is now running on http://localhost:4000

# 5. Open a new tab in the terminal and navigate back into my-app;
# then run the app
cd ..
yarn start

# 6. Open http://localhost:4000 in your browser
```

## Docs

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000` (only allows access to the _appl)
* `yarn dev` starts GraphQL server opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` defined in [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground for the `projects` defined in [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml)
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

### Project structure

#### `/sever` - configuration files

- [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](.graphqlconfig.yml) GraphQL configuration file containing the endpoints and schema configuration. Used by the [`graphql-cli`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-cli) and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground). See [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) for more information.

#### `/database` - Prisma service

- [`database/prisma.yml`](database/prisma.yml) The configuration file for your database service ([documentation](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/prisma.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip)).
- [`database/datamodel.graphql`](database/datamodel.graphql) contains the data model that you define for your database service (written in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)).

#### `/src` - application server

- [`src/schema.graphql`](src/schema.graphql) defines your **application schema**. It contains the GraphQL API that you want to expose to your client applications.
- [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) is the entry point of your server, putting everything together and starting the `GraphQLServer` from [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga).

#### `/src/generated` - generated files

- [`src/generated/prisma.graphql`](src/generated/prisma.graphql) defines the **database schema**. It contains the GraphQL API exposed by the Prisma Database. This file is automatically generated every time `yarn prisma deploy` is executed, according to the datamodel in `database/datamodel.graphql`.
